I'm writing a script for my mod but I don't know where to start
Let's go, to put the scripts in my mod, the folder for the scripts has to be like this.

scripts/Game (Here you are placing the main scripts in the mod.)
scripts/Game/extra (Here you are placing the extra scripts that you will be using for your music.)
scripts/characters (Here you are putting the scripts for your characters./It's somewhat similar to the Psych Engine.)
scripts/event (Here you are placing the scripts for the events, using (demonical.txt) as a reference to know where to put the .lua and .txt files.)
scripts/notetypes (Here you are placing the scripts for your custom notes.)
scripts/songs (Here you are adding the scripts for your music.)
scripts/stages (Here you are adding the scripts for your .lua stages for the mod.)
scripts/substate (This folder is still in the testing phase.)

In short,
the script folders for my mod are very similar to the base game of FNF.
Only the scripts/event and scripts/notetypes folders are different.
